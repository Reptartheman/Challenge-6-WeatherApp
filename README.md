## About

This weather app was built to complete an assignment from the FullStack Coding Bootcamp.
 

## Description

This weather app is a web based application that allows the user to search for the current weather and the 5 day forecast for whatever city they type into the search bar. I applied knowledge gained from the FullStack coding Bootcamp to allow elements to display on the page dynamically. For the sake of time I did not get the UI to appear exactly as I would want it to, but going forward I am going to have the UI make more sense with the 'Right Now' div display next to the search bar. 

## Technologies

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, OpenWeather API, Day.js, Local Storage, GitHub, VS code, Bootstrap, Google Fonts, Chrome Tools.
